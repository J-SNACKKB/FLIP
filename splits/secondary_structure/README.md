### Dataset description

The secondary structure split stem from three different publications, cited at the end, which aims at predicting the conservation score of the residues of a protein sequence.

This is a well-known dataset and it is used to validate the behavior of code and models. Only provided a `sampled` split for this purpose.

### Full dataset

The full dataset is divided in `train.jsonl`, `val.jsonl` and `new_pisces.jsonl`, JSONL files with proteins for training, validation and testing. Each line is a sample with id, sequence, label and resolved. There are 9712 proteins for training, 1080 proteins for validation and 648 proteins for testing.

Due to the size of these files, they can be found at http://data.bioembeddings.com/public/FLIP/fasta/secondary_structure/.

### Splits

All splits are classification splits as explained prior. Train/Test splits are done as follows.

Splits ([semaphore legend](../../README.md#split-semaphore)):
- ðŸŸ¢ `sampled`: Randomly split sequences into `train`/`test` with 95/5% probability.

All splits are contained in the `splits.zip` file. There is one `sequences.fasta` file with all the sequences of the splits in FASTA format and one FASTA file with the labels for each split, in this case only one `sampled.fasta`file.

The labels files are organized by sequence ID. Each sequence label has `SET` atribute (either `train` or `test`) and `VALIDATION` attribute (when True, these are sequences for train that may be used for validation (e.g. early stopping)). Example:
```
>Seq1 SET=train VALIDATION=False
HHHHHEEE
```

The labels are string encodings of sequences. For each amino acid there is a secondary structure class (`H` for helix, `E` for sheet, `C` for coil).
