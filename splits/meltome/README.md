### Dataset description

The dataset was downloaded (upon reboot of the hosting server, thanks to some of the manuscript authors) from http://meltomeatlas.proteomics.wzw.tum.de:5003 .

It contains "melting behaviour" and a "melting degree" for proteins in human and other species (in two files).

### Full dataset

The full dataset (`full_dataset.json`) contains a list of proteins with the following structure:
```
[
    {
      proteinId: [string from dataset],
      uniprotAccession: [if can be extracted],
      runName: [string from dataset],
      meltingPoint: [melting tempertature in C; may be null],
      quantNormMeltingPoint: [melting temp in C (for human sequences only); may be null]
      meltingBehaviour: [
        {
          tempertaure: [temperature in C],
          fold_change: [float usually between 0 and 1 (but can be higher or lower due to experimental weirdness)],
          channel: [string; present only for non-human]
        },
        {
          tempertaure: temp,
          fold_change: fchg,
          channel: channel
        },
        # ... [usually 10]
      ]
    },
    # ...
]
}
```

The combination of `proteinId` and `runName` may be used to uniquely identify a protein in one experiment, but unfortunately this doesn't always seem to hold true.

All sequences in the set where exported as fasta in the `full_dataset_sequences.fasta` file.
This file, in turn, was used to cluster sequences at 20% sequence identify via MMSeqs2 like so:

```
mmseqs easy-cluster --min-seq-id 0.2 meltome.fasta meltome_PIDE20.fasta tmp
```

The cluster file `meltome_PIDE20_clusters.tsv` was used to create train/test splits.

### Splits

The train/test splits were computed by splitting the clusters. 80% of the clusters were used for training, while 20% were used for testing.

Splits ([semaphore legend](../../README.md#split-semaphore)):
- ðŸŸ¢ `mixed`: uses cluster components for training and cluster representatives for testing (goal: avoid overestimaiting performance on big clusters in the test set)
- ðŸ”´ `full`: use all cluster components for training and testing
- ðŸ”´ `clustered`: use only cluster representatives for training and testing
- ðŸŸ¢ `human`: same as mixed, but using only seqeunces from the human set
- ðŸŸ¢ `human_cell`: same as mixed, but using only sequences from one cell line in the human set

All splits are contained in the `splits.zip` file. These are CSV with colums:

- `sequence`: the AA sequence. May contain special characters!
- `target`: the prediction target, which is float value (the splits is a regression).
- `set`: either `train` or `test`, if the sequence should be used for training or testing your model!
- `validation`: When `True`, these are sequences for train that may be used for validation (e.g. early stopping).
